\title{Visualize the output of siglasso, grouped and averaged, as a dotchart}
\usage{
plot_sigs_grouped(sig_weights, groups, stat = "mean")
}
\arguments{
\item{sig_weights}{A matrix of weigths of signatures in multiple 
samples}

\item{groups}{A vector of factors indicating the groups of each
samples. If not supplied, it will plot all samples individually}

\item{stat}{How to aggregate the weights in a group. Choose "mean" or 
"median". Default is mean.}
}
\description{
Show a dotchart of the signature fractions in samples, summarized
by groups. If groups are not supplied, it plots every sample
}
